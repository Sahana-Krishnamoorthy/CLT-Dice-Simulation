# Central-Limit-Theorem

## 🎲 Dice Simulation & Central Limit Theorem Visualization
This project demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a biased dice simulation. It visualizes how the distribution of dice sums approaches a normal distribution as the number of dice increases.

## 📚 Concept

The **Central Limit Theorem** states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution.

## 🔍 Project Overview
* Simulates rolling a biased six-sided die with custom probabilities.
* Visualizes the probability distribution of a single die.
* Demonstrates how the sum of dice rolls approximates a normal distribution as more dice are rolled, aligning with the Central Limit Theorem.
* Includes visually appealing gradient color plots on a dark theme.

## 💡 Future Improvements
* Add user input for custom dice probabilities.
* Increase the number of simulations for smoother distributions.
* Extend to multi-dimensional visualizations for more complex probability distributions.
