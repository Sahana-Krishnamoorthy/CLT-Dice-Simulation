## ðŸŽ² Dice Simulation & Central Limit Theorem Visualization
This project demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a biased dice simulation. It visualizes how the distribution of dice sums approaches a normal distribution as the number of dice increases.

## ðŸ“š Concept

The **Central Limit Theorem** states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution.
